        <h3>RACHEL WATSON</h3>
        <p>Rachel is the story’s alcoholic, self-deprecating, daydreaming, and unemployed primary narrator and protagonist. On her daily train ride, Rachel watches a couple at their home, who she dubbed Jason and Jess, through the train window, and dreams up scenarios about them. She fights with herself in a clash between her sober self and her drunk alter ego, more often than not creating problems for herself through her alcoholism. Sober Rachel tries to move forward and make progress with the police in finding the person behind the disappearance of Megan to prove to them that she herself is not the one behind it.</p>
        <p>Throughout the story, Rachel does her best to prove to herself that she’s not the monster she thinks she is. She finally conquers her conflict with herself at the end of the story: getting revenge against Tom and overcoming her crippling alcoholism.</p>
        <div class="quote">“It’s not just that I’ve put on weight, or that my face is puffy from the drinking and the lack of sleep; it’s as if people can see the damage written all over me, can see it in my face, the way I hold myself, the way I move.” pg. 11<br><br>“It’s Friday, so I don’t have to feel guilty about drinking on the train. TGIF.” pg. 3</div>
        <h3>TOM WATSON</h3>
        <p>Tom is the manipulative, deceitful, lying ex-husband of Rachel. Initially, he is seen as the loving husband of his now-wife Anna, and the one cleaning up all the fallout from his and Rachel’s divorce. Towards the end of the novel, Tom is revealed to be the one gaslighting and manipulating Rachel into believing she was at fault for Megan’s disappearance. Rachel believed she was abusive towards Tom during their marriage, and in one instance supposedly hitting him with a golf club.</p><p>In reality, Tom used Rachel’s blackout alcoholism to gaslight her and make her believe that she was the one being abusive when it was all his doing. As the story progresses, his facade fades, and his womanizing and misogynistic personality comes out.</p>
        <div class="quote">“I can see the muscles moving under his skin when he moves.” pg. 109<br><br>“‘You’re one of those dogs, the unwanted ones that have been mistreated all their lives. You can kick them and kick them, but they’ll still come back to you, cringing and wagging their tails. Begging. Hoping that this time it’ll be different, that this time they’ll do something right and you’ll love them. You’re just like that, aren’t you, Rach? You’re a dog.’” pg. 316</div>

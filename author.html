        <h3>Point of View</h3>
        <p>Hawkins uses a diary-esque format, utilizing the first-person point of view and a chronological order throughout the book, switching between the three primary female characters: Rachel, Anna, and Megan. This utilization of first-person writing allows the reader to see the process of the characters’ thoughts, as well as a deeper understanding of why they think the way they do. This is most evident with the protagonist, Rachel, as Hawkins uses the first-person point of view to show Rachel’s extreme development as a character by putting the reader inside her mind.</p>

        <h3>Imagery</h3>
        <p>Hawkins leaves virtually no detail unmentioned and uses vivid imagery throughout the book. Every scene has numerous descriptive details, from the initial scene on the train to the final revenge against Tom. The use of imagery plants the reader in the scene and helps them visualize the setting.</p>
        <div class="quote">“It was in the living room that the deja vu hit me, so strong it was almost frightening. I recognized the fireplace flanked by alcoves on the far wall, the way the light streamed in from the street through slanted blinds; I knew that when I turned to my left there would be glass and green and beyond that the railway line.” pg. 113

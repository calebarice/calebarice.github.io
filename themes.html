        <h3>TRAINS</h3>
        <p>In The Girl on the Train, trains are a recurring and prominent motif. Trains symbolize Rachel and Megan’s desire to abandon their bleak and stressful lives with the idea of a better world and many characters’ desire to escape societal expectations and their increasingly dangerous situations and relationships. In the book’s beginning chapters, Rachel creates her own stories about a married couple she sees from the train on her daily route.</p>
        <div class="quote">“Sometimes I don’t even watch the trains go past, I just listen. Sitting here in the morning, eyes closed and the hot sun orange on my eyelids, I could be anywhere. I could be in the south of Spain, at the beach; I could be in Italy, the Cinque Terre, all those pretty coloured houses and the trains ferrying the tourists back and forth.” Megan, p.16</div>

        <h3>ALCOHOLISM</h3>
        <p>The first chapter has multiple instances of Rachel drinking. Alcoholism is a prevalent and oft-recurring theme in the novel and symbolizes Rachel’s struggle with feelings of hopelessness and her own life immobility. She craves fulfillment yet always returns to her addictions. Instead of searching for a job after being fired from her last, she boards the same train every morning and perpetuates the very addiction that ruined her life in the first place.</p>

        <h3>BETRAYAL</h3>
        <p>Betrayal appears numerous times throughout the novel, the most obvious of which being Tom’s several occasions of betraying trust. For example, Tom cheated on Rachel with Anna while they were married, then he cheated on Anna with Megan while they were married. Megan also cheated on her husband, Scott, with Tom, and with her therapist, Kamal, as well.</p>
